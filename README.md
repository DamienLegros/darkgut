## Using the sequence, taxonomic and functional perspectives I analysed the Tume superfamily of proteins and concluded on the questions using figures, plots, tables and calculations.
Information on the data used in the analysis

### TumE.fasta
```
This file contains 860 protein sequences from the TumE superfamily, in FASTA format.
Each sequence’s header contains a UniProt Accession ID and a title, separated by a |.
```

### TumE_annotations.fasta
```
This file provides annotations for each of the 860 proteins, listed in the uniprotAC column.
The annotations include taxonomy (Superkingdom, Phylum, Taxa, Class, Family, Genus, Order and Species).
Two gene ontology (GO) term predictions 1 and 2. The GO terms represent function-related predictions generated by the DeepFRI tool.
For most proteins, the two top scoring predicted terms are listed, however some may only have one, these cases will have an empty value in the deepfri prediction 2 column.
